This repository provides a simple and yet comprehensive guide to creating and then integrating SpaDES 
compatible modules. It has a presentation and accompanying code. The files are described below:  
 

[SpaDES_presentation_Slides](https://github.com/tati-micheletti/Micheletti_SpaDES/blob/main/SpaDES_Presentation_Slides.pdf) and [SpaDES_presentation_Notes](https://github.com/tati-micheletti/Micheletti_SpaDES/blob/main/SpaDES_Presentation_Notes.pdf): This will be presented on *April 15th 2024* at the EFI/ESA [Statistical Ecology Section webinar series](https://ecoforecast.org/workshops/statistical-methods-seminar-series/#details), 
and live on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjE6j9Mw_K8). To register for the seminar, please [click here](https://notredame.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_7HIO_OJERCWpVbLEK_q5QA). This presentation explains what SpaDES and PERFICT are at a high level.  

[HandsOn.html](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/tati-micheletti/Micheletti_SpaDES/blob/main/HandsOn.html): This document provides a simple and yet comprehensive guide to creating and then integrating SpaDES compatible modules. It is divided in two parts. PART I focuses on the creation of a new SpaDES module from scratch, while PART II focuses on developing a new project and integrating the module created in PART I with two other SpaDES compatible modules hosted online.  

[demo.R](https://github.com/tati-micheletti/Micheletti_SpaDES/blob/main/demo.R): This document provides a simple but engaging simulation to demonstrate SpaDES. It is divided in three parts: 1. Installing the installers, 2. downloading the modules and installing needed libraries, and 3. running SpaDES.  

[exploringSpaDES.html](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/tati-micheletti/Micheletti_SpaDES/blob/main/exploringSpaDES.html): After the presentation and the demonstration, we will explore the results and the modules with this guide.  

In the repository we also provide a [data](https://github.com/tati-micheletti/Micheletti_SpaDES/tree/main/data) folder with the data used, which do NOT need to be downloaded on its own, as well as a [figures folder](https://github.com/tati-micheletti/Micheletti_SpaDES/tree/main/figures), used to create the guides.

If you encounter any problems while running these tutorials, please do not hesitate in contacting me by filling out an [issue](https://github.com/tati-micheletti/Micheletti_SpaDES/issues) in the repository.  

## Happy SpaDESing!
